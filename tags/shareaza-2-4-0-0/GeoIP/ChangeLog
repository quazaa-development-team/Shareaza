MinGW patch from Stanislaw Pusep

I was re-compiling Geolizer (http://sysd.org/log.php#glzr) on Win32 so I firstly needed to put up-to-date Win32 compatibility of libGeoIP itself. Fortunately MinGW plataform evolved a lot since last time I used it to compile libGeoIP. I'm sending you the patch with changes required for libGeoIP to work on both Win32 and UN*X. UN*X behavior is unaffected. Now, detailed explanation of what I did at all:
1) Made correct header imports for both Win32 and UN*X. UN*X imports netdb.h & netinet/in.h and Win32 imports windows.h & winsock.h
2) Win32 gethostbyname() is only able to resolve hostnames, it can't convert "127.0.0.1" string to 32-bit IP address. Thus I added lookupaddress() function that safely resolves any string to IP address and replaced all gethostbyname() calls by it.
3) Database files were referenced by pre-compiled static strings. I malloc()ed buffers for file names so they can be changed "on fly". Thus, on Win32 version GeoIP.dat & other files are being seeked in the same directory as executable file or library.
4) Added README.MinGW file with brief explanation on how to get GeoIP working under MinGW system.

1.3.1	2003-11-11
	* Check for stdint.h in autoconf (Sean Chittenden)
	* prevent the geoipupdate man page from trying to install itself directly in the system directory (Gyepi Sam)

1.3.0	2003-09-29
	* Fixed includes to compile on Windows (Fabrice Colin)
	* Removed the _addr_to_num() calls from GeoIP_*_by_name()
	* _seek_record() optimizations (Maurice Cinquini)
		 1) Use a single buf ptr inside the loops.
		    Set to the stack buffer or the cached memory the start of the function.
		 2) Unroll the i=0,1 loop to allow constant folding.
		 3) Unroll the j loop for the common case of j = STANDARD_RECORD_LENGTH
		    (I've already done the above changes see attached function.)
		    With gcc -O2 calculating x[0] and x[1] for STANDARD_RECORD_LENGTH now
		    only takes 15 (was > 100) i80x86 instructions with 6 byte accesses of RAM.                 4) only calculate x[0], x[1] when needed, may be a bigger win
		    than the above since all the other optimizations above only reduced
                    CPU instructions operating on CPU cached RAM.
	! IMPORTANT API Change: Changed GeoIPRegion to have region in structure. Saves space and a malloc.
	  Since GeoIPRegion.region is no longer a pointer but an in-structure
	  array so test the first byte of region == 0 rather testing if the region
	  pointer is NULL. (Maurice Cinquini)
	* Added GeoIP_assign_region_by_inetaddr which doesn't do any mallocs and made all other region APIs go thru it (Maurice Cinquini)
	* Replaced _h_addr_to_num() with ntohl() and removed _h_addr_to_num() (Maurice Cinquini)
