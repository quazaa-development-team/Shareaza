ofthen perople have either TCP opened but UDP, or UDP opened but TCP. Hub mode is allowed if
and only if both TCP and UDP are opened. to inclease number of Working nodes on network:

Hub - ordianlly Hub
Leaf - just a standard Leaf
TAP - tap node, which just have one of either TCP or UDP is opened, but not both.

the TAP node is partial Hubs which functions only when grouped up with other Hubs or different
types of TAPs, *node* below name is temporary naming:

UDP-TAP: only UDP is opened and TCP is firewalled.
TCP-TAP: only TCP is oepend and UDP is firewalled.

UDP-TAPs can be connected with HUBs,LEAFs,TCP-TAPs only but not with UDP-TAPs.
TCP-TAPs can be connected with HUBs,LEAFs,UDP-TAPs only but not with TCP-TAPs.

according to G2 spec, only a few basic rules for routing packets:

packets came into HUBs over UDP gets routed to all Neighbours via TCP.
packets came into HUBs over TCP gets routed to all LEAFs via TCP.
packets came into LEAFs never gets routed.



- TCP connections to UDP-TAPs basically use CALLBACK. TCP connections to TCP-TAPs is just
  standard Neighbour Handshake.

- UDP-TAPs are ones which receive UDP packet and routing it to others connected with TCP so
  it can virtually be one of the node like HUBs which recieve UDP.

- TCP-TAPs are ones which just routing packets came on TCP connection to the others. so is
  like routing PEER-to-LEAF part of HUB node.
