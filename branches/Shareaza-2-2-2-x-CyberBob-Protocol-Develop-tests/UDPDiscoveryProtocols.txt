Modified "Bootstrap" type to hold them.

to use UDP stuffs adding address with prefix:

* Prefix "uhc:" for Gnutella1 UDP HostCache.
* Prefix "ukhl:" for Gnutella2 UDP Known Hub Cache.(Still in test phase)

for some extra, there is way to use TCP connections.

* Prefix "gnutella1:host:" will make Gnutella1 connection to the address specified.
* Prefix "gnutella2:host:" will make Gnutella2 connection to the address specified.
