for Gnutella File transfers, it use HTTP protocol, and basically either "Active Queuing" or
PARQ queuing. both have advantages and disadvantages.

Active Queuing is good at keep tracking of Queuing state. however, it has some over head
specially nodes behind router. HOME personal Router's Connection tracking table is normally
not big so if there is ACTIVE connection just waiting for next QueueUpdate time is just
wasting resources. moreover this is just HTTP, doing something else while in Queue cause
Connection drop, so getting status actively, informing the other end, when to start the
transaction dynamically is not possible unless using some other connection separately.

PARQ Queue is, on the otherhand, is just use Periodical Access to update Queue status and
with TCP, there is no resource waste on router's connection tracking, how ever it is TCP
so frequent "Connect" and "Disconnect" cause more TCP packets (i.e. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK, FIN,
FIN/ACK) to be sent and received. so not efficient either.


idea to solve this*

Transfer/Network Mixed connection, using G2 packet to transfer DATA to the other end. with
this one, it is active connection, but not wasting resource with just waiting like Active
Queuing. it can carry some other info, like if some user decided to start the upload for
someone on the list, "active queuing" have time-rug untill next status update time. however
Mixed connection use Binary transaction so is easy to inform the other side, that it is ready
to upload. the other thing it can do is, like use one connection to do CHAT/BROWSE/QUERY/TRANSACTION
on one single connection, which can reduce number of connection in certain situation.
