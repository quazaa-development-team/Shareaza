It's a basic sketch of IRC plugin.

ToDo: migrate IRC code from RazaIRC branch.
The problem which has to be solved is to allow to create windows in frames which could inherit
IPluginWindowOwner interface, so every window could be skinned/translated.

Modified Shareaza files are in Shareaza folder.
Shareaza.idl is VB6 compatible for plugin architecture with additional methods (not all implemented).
